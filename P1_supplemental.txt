Answer questions marked as "QS"

QS1.1:
DFS uses a stack. DFS goes as deep as possible into the maze before backtracking to the most recent unexplored path.
A Stack is the optimal data structure for this because it can quickly push values to go deep into the maze and then quickly 
pop values until the most recent unexplored path is found. 

QS1.2:
Yes, the exploration order is what was expected. Pacman does NOT go to all the explored states since DFS had to backtrack a few times.
